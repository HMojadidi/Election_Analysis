# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project

I have been hired by the Colorado Board of Elections employee to help complete the audit of a recent local congressional election.

### Purpose

The purpose of this audit is to perform the following tasks:

    .   Calculate the total number of votes cast.
    .   Compile a list of candidates who received votes.
    .   Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
    .   Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
    .   The winner of the election basedon popular vote.

For the added challenge, I am required to also find:

    .   The vote turnout for each county.
    .   The percentage of votes from each county out of the total vote count.
    .   The county with the highest voter turnout.
