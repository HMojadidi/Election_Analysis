# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project

I have been hired by the Colorado Board of Elections employee to help complete the audit of a recent local congressional election.

### Purpose

The purpose of this audit is to perform the following tasks:

    .   Calculate the total number of votes cast.
    .   Compile a list of candidates who received votes.
    .   Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
    .   Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
    .   The winner of the election basedon popular vote.

For the added challenge, I am required to also find:

    .   The vote turnout for each county.
    .   The percentage of votes from each county out of the total vote count.
    .   The county with the highest voter turnout.

### Resources

.   Data Source: election_results.csv
.   Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code

## Results

The analysis of the election showed the following results:

    .   There were 369,711 votes cast in this election
    .   The 3 candidates, the number of their votes and percentage of votes were:
    .   Charles Casper Stockhom: 23.0 % (85,213)

    .   Raymon Anthony Doanne: 3.1% (11,606)

## Summary

The audit extracted the required information from the election data records. After some trial and error, I was able to produce codes to help run an analysis on the data. I used Python in Visual Studio Code and the following prinout is from the Terminal.
